## üìà Models Explained

### CatBoost
A gradient boosting library with categorical feature support, providing high accuracy for stock prediction tasks with excellent handling of market data features.

### LGBMBoost (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)
Optimized for efficiency and speed, particularly effective for large datasets with many features from technical indicators.

### SFM (State Frequency Memory)
A specialized neural network architecture that effectively captures multi-frequency patterns in time series data, particularly suited for financial market prediction.

## üîÑ Workflow Example

1. **Data Collection**: `python Scripts/collect_indian_data.py`
2. **Data Validation**: `python Scripts/check_data_health.py`
3. **Format Conversion**: `python Scripts/dump_bin.py`
4. **Model Training**: Run `Notebooks/indian_workflow.ipynb`
5. **Strategy Testing**: Implement using files in the Strategies folder.
6. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate results and adjust models.

## üìä Prediction Capabilities

The system is designed to predict:
- Price movements for major Indian stocks.
- Market trends using technical indicators.
- Optimal entry/exit points based on model signals.
- Risk assessment based on market conditions.
